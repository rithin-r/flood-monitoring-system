Concept & Working:

Measurement: Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) calculates the distance to the water surface to determine water level.

Processing: ESP32 reads sensor data and compares it to a predefined threshold (e.g., 50 cm).

Local Alerts: If water level exceeds the threshold, LED turns ON and Buzzer sounds as a warning.

Display: OLED screen shows real-time water level readings locally.

Cloud Update: ESP32 sends water level data every 15 seconds to ThingSpeak via WiFi.

Remote Monitoring: Authorities can monitor live graphs on ThingSpeak to assess flood risk and act promptly.
