# flood-monitoring-system
This project simulates a flood monitoring system using ESP32 microcontroller and sends water level data to ThingSpeak cloud for real-time monitoring. Local alerts are triggered when water levels exceed safe thresholds.

Aim:
To design and simulate a flood monitoring system that:

Continuously measures water levels at a dam.

Sends real-time alerts to authorities via cloud when the water level exceeds a threshold, indicating potential flood risks.

Problem Statement:
Floods cause massive damage to life and property. Monitoring water levels in real-time at vulnerable locations (like dams) can help issue early warnings and take preventive measures. This project simulates a system to measure water levels and send alerts using IoT technologies.

Scope of Solution:
Real-time water level monitoring with an ultrasonic sensor.

Visual and audio alerts using LED and buzzer for local indication.

Cloud connectivity via Wi-Fi (ESP32) to upload data to ThingSpeak.

Data visualization on ThingSpeak for remote monitoring.
